# Advanced Bioinformatics Algorithms

Topics covered:
- Pattern matching
- Burrows-Wheeler transform based pattern matching
- Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi algorithm and Dynamic programming
- Baum-Welch learning

These are my solutions to the [Bioinformatics VI Course - Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-mutations) on Coursera. All solutions have been verified to be correct.

### Requirements
- Python 2.7+
- Numpy
- Numba (optional - improves efficiency for one of the solutions)
